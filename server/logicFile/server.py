    - it fights that site's anti-bot measures server-side and has been far
    more reliable than driving yt-dlp against TikTok directly. Any
    failure there (or a non-TikTok URL) falls through to yt-dlp: a plain
    download first, then Chrome's cookies (the browser the user is
    actually logged into TikTok in - Safari's cookie store needs Full Disk
    Access and reliably fails to even open under this app's sandboxing, so
    it's not worth a wasted attempt). If both yt-dlp attempts still fail,
    it runs `yt-dlp -U` (the extractor itself may just be behind for this
    site) and gives the Chrome-cookies attempt one last try before giving
    up with a short, actionable message.

    Downloads straight into the job's own job_dir (not a separate temp
    dir) - app.py writes its output NEXT TO its input video with no
    separate output-dir argument, so the source has to already be sitting
    where run_job expects the output to land too. It's still cleaned up
    like a temp file (see run_job) - just deleted as one specific file
    instead of a whole directory, since the job_dir also holds the real
    output that must survive that cleanup.

    Format selection is "bv*+ba/b" (best video + best audio, merged; fall
    back to best pre-combined) - NEVER a bare "mp4" alternative first,
    since that matches any mp4-extension stream including a video-only
    one and yt-dlp will happily pick it without ever trying to add audio.
